# **Chess Web Application Project Overview**

## **Introduction**

As part of my academic studies, I collaborated with a team to develop an advanced Chess Web Application. This project aimed to create a comprehensive online platform for chess enthusiasts, incorporating features like user registration, friend lists, chess gameplay, chess clubs, puzzles, leaderboards, game history, and more.

## My Role and Contributions

##### In this project, I primarily focused on the frontend development, leveraging my skills in React, React-Query, React-Router and other web technologies. My major contributions included:

-Homepage Development: Crafted the first interaction point for users, ensuring a user-friendly and engaging interface.

-Lobby Component: Implemented a system for users to create, join, play and manage chess games.

-Sidebar Design: Enhanced user navigation through an intuitive sidebar, improving the overall user experience.

-Invite System: Developed a feature allowing users to invite others to play, enhancing user interaction within the app.

-Rejoin System: Enabled players to rejoin games, ensuring a seamless gaming experience.

-Play vs Computer: Integrated an AI feature that allows users to play against a computer, using the Stockfish library, and catering to various levels of chess expertise.

#### Backend Involvement

While my primary focus was on frontend development, I also gained substantial insights into the backend architecture. This included:

Understanding the connection between frontend and backend services.

Assisting in implementing various backend functionalities, enhancing my full-stack development skills.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was instrumental in sharpening my web development skills. Key learnings include:

#### Full-Stack Awareness:
